# Streamlit Yoga Customizing App

## Goal
Develop a Streamlit application that interacts with the Gemini API to generate personalized yoga flows based on user inputs such as experience level, focus areas, and special considerations.

## Getting Started
To set up this project locally, follow these installation steps:

```
python -m venv venv                           # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate                      # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate                         # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt               # Install dependencies
streamlit run app.py                          # Run the Streamlit application
```

## Lessons Learned
During the development of this application, I learned about:

- **API Integration**: Mastered the process of integrating and leveraging the Gemini API for dynamic content generation.
- **User Experience**: Understood the importance of creating a seamless and intuitive user interface using Streamlit.
- **Data Privacy**: Adopted secure methods to handle sensitive information like API keys using Streamlit's secrets management.

## Reflections and Questions
Reflecting on the project, several questions arise that can guide future improvements:

- **Error Handling**: How can the application better handle potential API errors or downtime?
- **User Engagement**: What features could enhance user engagement and encourage repeated use of the application?
- **Scalability**: How can the application be scaled to handle a growing number of users and increased complexity?

## Next Steps
The following steps are planned to improve the app:

- **Pose Database Expansion**: To provide a more comprehensive library of yoga poses and sequences for all experience levels.
- **Image Integration**: To include visual aids for each yoga pose to enhance the instructional value of the generated content.
- **Personalization Features**: To allow users to save their favorite flows and settings for future sessions.
- **Community Interaction**: To create a platform within the app for users to share and discuss their favorite yoga flows.
