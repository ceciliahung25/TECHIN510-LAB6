# Streamlit Yoga Customizing App

## Goal
Develop a Streamlit application that interacts with the Gemini API to generate personalized yoga flows based on user inputs such as experience level, focus areas, and special considerations.

## Getting Started
To set up this project locally, follow these installation steps:


```
python -m venv venv                           # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate                      # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate                         # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt               # Install dependencies
streamlit run llm_app.py                          # Run the Streamlit application
```


## Lessons Learned
During the development of this application, I learned about:

- **API Integration**: Mastered the process of integrating and leveraging the Gemini API for dynamic content generation.
- **User Experience**: Understood the importance of creating a seamless and intuitive user interface using Streamlit.
- **Data Privacy**: Adopted secure methods to handle sensitive information like API keys using Streamlit's secrets management.

## Reflections and Questions
Reflecting on the project, several questions arise that can guide future improvements:

- **Error Handling**: How can the application better handle potential API errors or downtime?
- **User Engagement**: What features could enhance user engagement and encourage repeated use of the application?
- **Scalability**: How can the application be scaled to handle a growing number of users and increased complexity?

## Challenges and Prompting Techniques
During development, I encountered several challenges related to effectively leveraging the Gemini API. These include ensuring the app generates relevant and coherent responses and handling the complexity of user inputs. To address these challenges, I explored new prompting techniques:

- **Structured Prompts**: Initially, the model produced inconsistent outputs due to vaguely defined prompts. By adopting more structured prompts that clearly define the context and expectations, the model's responses became more relevant and useful.
- **Error Handling in Prompts**: Incorporating error detection and response strategies directly within the prompts helped manage instances when the API returned errors or unexpected results, enhancing the robustness of the application.
- **Use of Delimiters**: Implementing delimiters to separate different sections of the input ensured that the model accurately understood and responded to complex multi-part queries, significantly improving the precision of the generated content.

## Next Steps
The following steps are planned to improve the app:

- **Pose Database Expansion**: To provide a more comprehensive library of yoga poses and sequences for all experience levels.
- **Image Integration**: To include visual aids for each yoga pose to enhance the instructional value of the generated content.
- **Personalization Features**: To allow users to save their favorite flows and settings for future sessions.
- **Community Interaction**: To create a platform within the app for users to share and discuss their favorite yoga flows.
